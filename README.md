# This is my Portfolio for 2020

With learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jquery. I wanted to update my portfolio for the new year and also since its a homework assignment. 

Basically revamped the style to something more "Me" and added some effects that I have just learned.  Added new logos, icons, and backgrounds that I designed myself.

So far I only have 3 projects but I will be adding more with time.
